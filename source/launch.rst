Getting Started
===============

*xara* is a free and open source tool for simulating the nonlinear response of structural and geotechnical systems. 
*xara* is developed by PEER as an alternative front-end to the simulation framework proposed by `McKenna (1997) <https://opensees.stairlab.io/developer/references.html>`_.
The design of the interface was guided by the demands of the *BRACE2* project, for which a suitably *reliable* and *performant* solution was not available.
