.. _kwds:

Keyword Arguments
-----------------

It is common to see the argument ``**kwds`` in Python function signatures.
This is a way to pass a variable number of keyword arguments to a function.
The double asterisks in front of the argument name ``kwds`` is what allows
this to happen. The name ``kwds`` is arbitrary and can be anything you like.
