Static
^^^^^^

In static nonlinear finite element problems we seek a solution
(:math:`\boldsymbol{u}`, :math:`\lambda`) to the nonlinear vector
function

.. math::

   \boldsymbol{r}(\boldsymbol{u}, \lambda) = \lambda \boldsymbol{p}_f - \boldsymbol{p}_r(\boldsymbol{u}) = \boldsymbol{0}


In an incremental scheme, a solution to this
equation is sought at successive incremental steps.

.. math::


   \boldsymbol{r}(\boldsymbol{u}_{n}, \lambda_n) = \lambda_n \boldsymbol{p}_f - \boldsymbol{p}_{\sigma}(\boldsymbol{u}_{n})

The solution of this equation is typically obtained using an iterative
procedure, in which a sequence of approximations
(:math:`\boldsymbol{u}_{n}^{(i)}`, :math:`\lambda_n^{(i)}`),
:math:`i=1,2, ..` is obtained which converges to the solution
(:math:`\boldsymbol{u}_n`, :math:`\lambda_n)`. The most frequently used
iterative schemes, such as Newton-Raphson, modified Newton, and quasi
Newton schemes, are based on a Taylor expansion of
equationÂ `staticIncForm <#staticIncForm>`__ about
(:math:`\boldsymbol{u}_{n}`, :math:`\lambda_n`):

.. math::


   \mathcal{L} \boldsymbol{r}(\boldsymbol{u}, \lambda)(\boldsymbol{u}_{n},\lambda_n) = \lambda_n^{(i)} \boldsymbol{p}_f 
    - \boldsymbol{p}_{\sigma}\left(\boldsymbol{u}_{n}^{(i)} \right) - \left[
   \begin{array}{cc}
   \boldsymbol{K}_n^{(i)} & -\boldsymbol{p}_f \\
   \end{array} \right] 
   \left(
   \begin{array}{c}
   \boldsymbol{u}_{n} - \boldsymbol{u}_{n}^{(i)}  \\ 
   \lambda_n - \lambda_n^{(i)} 
   \end{array} \right)

which a system of of :math:`N` equations with (:math:`N+1`) unknowns.
Two solve this, an additional equation is required, the constraint
equation. 
The constraint equation used depends on the static integration
scheme, of which there are a number, for example load control, arc
length, and displacement control.
