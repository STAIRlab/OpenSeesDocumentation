Welcome to the STAIRLab's OpenSees documentation.

The Open System for Earthquake Engineering Simulation (OpenSees) is a software framework designed to simulate the dynamic behavior of structural and geotechnical systems. Originally developed as the computational platform for performance-based earthquake engineering research at the Pacific Earthquake Engineering Research Center, OpenSees is now widely utilized as a finite element tool to analyze the response of structures to various natural hazards, including fire, wind, earthquakes, and wave actions from tsunamis or storm surges.

As part of the ongoing code development efforts, several applications built using the framework have been made available. The use of these applications is detailed in the following chapters.
