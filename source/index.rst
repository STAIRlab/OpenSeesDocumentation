xara
====

*xara* is a free and open source tool for simulating the nonlinear response of structural and geotechnical systems. 
*xara* is developed by PEER as an alternative front-end to the simulation framework proposed by McKenna (1997).
The design of the interface is distinguished by its emphasis on (1) performance and (2) robustness.

    * to provide a robust simulation framework that is appropriate for use in production environments
    Originally developed as the computational platform for performance-based earthquake engineering research at the Pacific Earthquake Engineering Research Center, OpenSees is now widely utilized as a finite element tool to analyze the response of structures to various natural hazards, including fire, wind, earthquakes, and wave actions from tsunamis or storm surges.
